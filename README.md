# <p align='center'>Daily Checkmate</p>

**Daily Checkmate** is a simple productivity app that helps you to keep track of all your daily tasks, schedule, and even your daily habits. 📈

### Backstory 📖

I have been using a lot of productivity apps, but none of them really suits my needs. Moreover, I often forget to check my tasks and schedule. I want to have a simple app that can help me keep track of my daily tasks, schedule, and habits. I also wanted to get forced to check my tasks and schedule. None of the apps that I have used can do that. One day I noticed that I always open my browser every day, especially in the morning. So, I thought, why not build a simple app that will open up every time I open my browser. That's how I came up with the idea of Daily Checkmate. 💡

You can try it yourself. I'm using Chrome as my main browser. I set the homepage to the app's homepage. So, every time I open Chrome, I will be forced to check my tasks and schedule. Here's how to set the homepage in Chrome:

1. On your computer, open Chrome.
2. At the top right, click More ⋮ and then Settings.
3. Under "On startup," select Open a specific page or set of pages.
4. Click Add a new page. Enter the web address and click Add.
